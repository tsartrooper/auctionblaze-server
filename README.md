# AuctionBlaze-Server



The json data format is given below.

**Background:**

Online auction sites are websites that facilitate buying and selling goods via a bidding process. This a backend system for such online auctions. This project makes use of Springboot for managing apis and database connections. 

**Goals:**

•	Providing REST APIs for User Authentication and Auction Management

•	Scheduling Auctions.

•	Caching API requests.

**Non Goals(what it will not cover):**

•	Frontend implementation and payment gateway integration.

•	Testing of the functionalties.


**Architecture Overview:**

**High Level Design:**
This is project particularly follows modular monolith architecture practices. The individual modules are loosely coupled for potential of this project breaking down into microservices down the line.

Authentication(Spring Auth)
JWT based authentication Spring Auth was used. JWT was used instead of session/cookie based authentication to reduce the load on the server.

**Caching(Redis):**
For Caching, a key-value datastore, Redis a was used, because it has simple structure compared to other caches. 

**Scheduling(Spring Quartz Scheduler):**
For Scheduling Spring Quartz scheduler was used.

**Data Storage(Postgres):**
For Database Postgres was used.Port-Adapter Design pattern is implemented, to maintain interdependency between modules as loosely coupled as possible, this typically was inspired by modular monolilth architecture.


**API Overview:**

**1.	Authentication** 

•	Post auth/register: Register a new user.

•	Post Auth/ login: User login returns JSON Web Token

**2.	Auction Catalog**
•	Get /catalog/all get all the recent aauctions.

•	Catalog/seller/{seller_id} get all auction of a particular seller.


**3.	Auction Management**
•	Post  /auctions create an auction.

•	Get /auctions get all the auctions

•	Get auctions/{auction_id} get auction by id

**4.	Bids management**
•	POST  /bids create a bid

•	GET /bids get all bids 

•	GET /bids/{bidder_id} get bids by bidder id

**5.	Item Listing**

•	POST /items/owned get all the items owned by the user.

**6.	User Module**
•	GET /users get all the users/
